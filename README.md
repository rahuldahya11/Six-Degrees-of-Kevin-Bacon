# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

## Contex
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or "Bacon's Law" is a parlor game based on "six degrees of seperation" concept, which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. Bacon's Law rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps.
